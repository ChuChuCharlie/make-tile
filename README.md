# MakeTile
A 3D printable dungeon tile creator addon for Blender 3.01

A series of videos on how to use MakeTile can be found on my YouTube channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TUNzEtli-sQRj5anS7DFA

Documentation can be found at https://maketile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Make sure you download the latest release by going to https://github.com/richeyrose/make-tile/releases and then downloading the latest MakeTile.zip file as this contains a .blend file with assets that are necessary for MakeTile to work.

MakeTile ran a succesful Kickstarter in 2020 and you can find all the updates here https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modmodterrain/maketile-custom-dungeon-tile-creator

You can purchase the commercial version of MakeTile from Gumroad at https://gumroad.com/products/LaLVb

This includes an asset manager and allows you to use MakeTile materials for commercial purposes.
