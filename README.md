# make-tile
A 3D printable dungeon tile creator addon for Blender 2.82.

A series of videos on how to use MakeTile can be found on my YouTube channel here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TUNzEtli-sQRj5anS7DFA

Make sure you download the latest release by going to Releases > Assets and then downloading the MakeTile.zip file as this contains a .blend file with assets that are necessary for MakeTile to work.
